# **MEMEVELLI: Autonomous Capital Agents**

![Memevelli Banner](./memevelli_banner_1773063048752.png)

## **Build autonomous agents that move capital across chains**

AI agents are becoming the new users of crypto. They trade, they farm yield, they rebalance portfolios, and they execute strategies faster and more consistently than humans ever could.

**Memevelli** is an autonomous agent framework powered by [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [LI.FI](https://li.fi/), designed to move capital across chains, protocols, and ecosystems through a single unified interface.

---

## **Why This Plugin Matters: The Missing LI.FI x ElizaOS Bridge**

> **There is currently no independent, production-ready LI.FI plugin in the official ElizaOS plugin registry.**

[ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) is the **largest and most widely adopted crypto AI agent framework** in the ecosystem, with thousands of developers building on it. Despite this, there has been no native way for Eliza agents to perform cross-chain token swaps, bridges, or memecoin purchases using real on-chain execution — until now.

**Memevelli fills this gap** by introducing `@elizaos/plugin-lifi`, a fully functional, open-source LI.FI plugin that:

- Integrates cleanly with the ElizaOS agent architecture
- Exposes bridge, buy, and balance-check actions to any Eliza character
- Is designed to be submitted to the **official ElizaOS plugin registry** so every future Eliza developer can benefit from it

This means that any developer building an Eliza agent — whether for trading bots, portfolio managers, or autonomous DeFi participants — will be able to drop in this plugin and gain full cross-chain execution power through LI.FI, without having to build it themselves.

---

## **Objective**

The goal of Memevelli is to provide a working template for an AI agent that uses **LI.FI** to execute real on-chain strategies. Memevelli doesn't just call a swap endpoint; it actively uses LI.FI as part of its autonomous execution loop to:

- **Move funds** across chains to follow the most viral narratives.
- **Execute trades** on meme coins across Arbitrum, Base, BSC, Ethereum, and more.
- **Rebalance portfolios** based on real-time sentiment analysis and alpha signals.

---

## **Key Capabilities (Powered by LI.FI)**

Memevelli integrates the LI.FI SDK directly into the agent's decision-making process via custom actions:

### 🔄 **LIFI_EXECUTE_BRIDGE**
Allows the agent to move USDC across any supported chain. If the agent detects a hot narrative on Base but its funds are on Arbitrum, it will automatically bridge the capital to where the action is.
- *Example:* `"Bridge 0.5 USDC from Base to Arbitrum"`

### 🚀 **LIFI_EXECUTE_BUY**
Enables the agent to purchase meme tokens on any target chain using its current holdings. The agent calculates the best route via LI.FI to minimize slippage and gas costs.
- *Example:* `"Buy $WIF on BSC"` or `"The PEPE narrative is heating up, buy some."`

### 📊 **LIFI_CHECK_BALANCE**
Provides the agent with real-time visibility into its multichain holdings, allowing it to make informed allocations.

---

## **You Don't Need USDC on Every Chain**

This is one of the most powerful — and least understood — features of the LI.FI integration.

**Traditional platforms require you to manually bridge funds before you can trade on a new chain.** If you want to buy a memecoin on Base but all your USDC is on Arbitrum, you'd normally have to:
1. Go to a bridge
2. Wait for the bridge to complete
3. Go to a DEX on Base
4. Execute the trade

**With Memevelli, the agent handles all of this in a single command.** The LI.FI plugin automatically detects which chain has sufficient liquidity, initiates the bridge, and executes the buy — all in one unified flow. You can hold all your capital on Arbitrum and still buy memecoins on Base, Ethereum, or BSC without ever manually moving funds.

### **Memevelli vs. GmGn (and similar platforms)**

| Feature | GmGn / Photon / BullX | Memevelli + LI.FI |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-chain buying | ❌ Manual bridging required | ✅ Automatic, agent-driven |
| Natural language input | ❌ Manual UI clicks | ✅ `"Buy PEPE on Ethereum"` |
| Autonomous strategy execution | ❌ Human operated | ✅ Fully autonomous |
| Multi-agent coordination | ❌ Single user | ✅ Multiple characters (Edd, Ed, Eddy) |
| Narrative-driven trading | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Built-in via ElizaOS |
| Requires funds per chain | ✅ Yes | ❌ No, LI.FI bridges automatically |

Platforms like GmGn are excellent for manual traders who want speed and convenience on a single chain. **Memevelli is for the next paradigm** — where the agent *is* the trader, operating across all chains simultaneously, without human intervention.

## **Why LI.FI?**

LI.FI gives Memevelli-powered agents the ability to navigate the fragmented liquidity of the multichain world. By using the **LI.FI SDK**, Memevelli-powered agents can:

- Source liquidity from over 30+ DEXs.
- Access 14+ Bridges.
- Support 20+ Chains.
- Handle complex cross-chain swaps in a single transaction.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v23+)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.1+)
- An **OpenRouter API key** — used as the LLM backend for the Eliza agents. Get one at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
- A **wallet private key** — a burner wallet is strongly recommended. The agent will use this wallet to sign and send transactions. Fund it with a small amount of USDC and native gas tokens (ETH on Base/Arbitrum, etc.)
- Your **wallet public address** — the checksummed address corresponding to your private key
- *(Optional)* A **LI.FI API key** — not required but unlocks higher rate limits. Get one at [li.fi](https://li.fi/)

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** Never use a wallet that holds significant funds. Always use a dedicated burner wallet for agent operations. Your private key will be stored in a `.env` file — never commit this file to source control.
